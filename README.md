 # Artifical Intelligence

This repo contains AI Projects completed in Python with Google Colab. TensorFlow, Keras, Numpy, and Matplotlib libraries are used to conduct matrix multiplication, plot data on 2D and 3D graphs, perform convolution and pooling operations, display the MNIST digits, and build, train, and finetune models.
